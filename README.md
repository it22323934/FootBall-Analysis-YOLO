 Used a pre-trained model YOLOv5xu. Additional training was done to identify only the players and referees within the football court. Use of ball interpolation for predicting the path of the ball and tracking the ball, use of colour segmentation to assign players with different team colours, use of camera movement estimators and perspective transformer to calculate the speed and distance covered by each player within the desired polygon.
